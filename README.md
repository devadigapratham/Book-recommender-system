# Book-recommender-system
Basic Book Recommendation System using Machine Learning and HTML CSS . Data set for the books can be downloaded here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset     . After downloading the dataset, it has to be converted to a .pkl file and then added to this file so as to be able to use the recommender system I made.
