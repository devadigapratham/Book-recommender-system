# Book-recommender-system

This is a basic book recommendation system developed using machine learning algorithms and HTML/CSS for the web interface. To build this system, I used the book recommendation dataset available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset.

To use this recommendation system, the downloaded dataset must first be converted to a .pkl file and added to the project files. This will enable the recommender system to access and analyze the data effectively.
